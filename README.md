## Introduction
I conducted a usability test of weather.gov with one plot tester. [Weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)

**The main usability issues from the heuristic evaluation that needed to be addressed first:** 
* Consistency and standards
* User control and freedom
* Aesthetic and minimalist design 

**What is UT?**

Usability Testing, or UT, is a way of testing how usable a site is. In having pilot tests and conducting small tests of users on a site, the company or designers of a website can see what is functional and not so easy to use. UT provides valuable, empirical feedback from the user that can hopefully be used to make improvements on the website. It is a good way to check your heuristic evaluation with real users. A heuristic evaluation does not give you real feedback from users, UT allows the creators to step away from the product and observe how it functions with real users. UT can help with further improvements in design and functionality and hopefully profitability.

**What I Wanted to Test**

Through my heuristic evaluation I found that user control and freedom and consistency and standards were my top priorities to be fixed. I though that they were the most frustrating parts of the website and were the most important to fix; they were top priority. For user control and freedom, I found that the website did not keep certain aspects of retracing one’s steps back easily. I, as someone more tech savvy than the other, older people in my household struggled with this function, so I thought it would be good to test on my parent and see how they were able to figure that function out. I tested this control by asking my user to navigate back to the home page without using the back tab arrows. Consistency and standards was the other function I thought was important to fix on weather.gov. Depending on what headings you clicked on in the website, it might keep the same style or change to a different website with a completely different look. I felt that this was a major function that needed to be streamlined to make the user’s experience as smooth as possible. I tested this through having different tasks that asked the user to do something that I knew would take them to a different layout and then saw their reaction to the change.

Aesthetic and minimalist design is another function I thought would need improvements, but with the fixing of consistency and standards, I think that aesthetic and minimalist design would be improved through that.
