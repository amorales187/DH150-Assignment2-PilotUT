## Introduction
I conducted a usability test of weather.gov with one plot tester. [Weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/)

**The main usability issues from the heuristic evaluation that needed to be addressed first:** 
* Consistency and standards
* User control and freedom
* Aesthetic and minimalist design 

**What is UT?**

Usability Testing, or UT, is a way of testing how usable a site is. In having pilot tests and conducting small tests of users on a site, the company or designers of a website can see what is functional and not so easy to use. UT provides valuable, empirical feedback from the user that can hopefully be used to make improvements on the website. It is a good way to check your heuristic evaluation with real users. A heuristic evaluation does not give you real feedback from users, UT allows the creators to step away from the product and observe how it functions with real users. UT can help with further improvements in design and functionality and hopefully profitability.

**What I Wanted to Test**

Through my heuristic evaluation I found that user control and freedom and consistency and standards were my top priorities to be fixed. I though that they were the most frustrating parts of the website and were the most important to fix; they were top priority. For user control and freedom, I found that the website did not keep certain aspects of retracing one’s steps back easily. I, as someone more tech savvy than the other, older people in my household struggled with this function, so I thought it would be good to test on my parent and see how they were able to figure that function out. I tested this control by asking my user to navigate back to the home page without using the back tab arrows. Consistency and standards was the other function I thought was important to fix on weather.gov. Depending on what headings you clicked on in the website, it might keep the same style or change to a different website with a completely different look. I felt that this was a major function that needed to be streamlined to make the user’s experience as smooth as possible. I tested this through having different tasks that asked the user to do something that I knew would take them to a different layout and then saw their reaction to the change.

Aesthetic and minimalist design is another function I thought would need improvements, but with the fixing of consistency and standards, I think that aesthetic and minimalist design would be improved through that.

## Discussion 

**What I Learned**

During this pilot test, I learned a lot. The most important thing I learned from this test was not about the usability of the website, but conducting the test itself. After going through the survey and the tasks and having the video recording, I stopped the video and waited to save, but something went wrong with video recording app and it would not respond so I was forced to quit the app and I lost my data. I had to redo the survey, tasks, and recording. I learned that it is very important to do your testing with enough time before the deadline, so you can prepare for mishaps like that. I also learned that many of the functions that I found to be not be user friendly in my heuristic evaluation, were some of the same things my tester also found to be difficult, such as navigating back to a home screen or the disjointed nature of the different links to websites that were accessible within the weather.gov functions. I also learned more from my user about how the information presented was confusing to users, many users want simple answers and weather.gov did not provide that too many times.

**What Went Well**

My user caught on to some of the things I did not like about the website, such as the different websites that came up (consistency and standards). She also expressed many times, how it was hard to understand the information that was given because it was so complex and not presented in a user friendly way (aesthetic and minimalist design). When the data was easy to read, she expressed that she liked how succinct it was compared to previous things she encountered earlier. 

**What Did Not Go Well**

The clearest thing that did not go well, was the video recording. Losing almost 30 minutes of my user test was a big hit to this UT practice. I also think that my skills as a moderator need to be improved, as I was not sure when I should intervene. 

**Things to Improve**

Going forward, in the future, for usability testing, I would like to prevent any hiccups from happening. As a moderator, I do not know if I did everything right. I wasn’t sure when I should give help or speak. Moving forward I would like to improve my skills as a moderator. Through the test, I found that the three major heuristics I thought needed to be improved as the user found them difficult to use or cumbersome. Through the test an user feedback, it was discovered that how the information and how much information is presented needs to be changed to allow for easier user use (flexibility and efficiency of use).
